[01:53:50] Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
[01:53:50] And sorry I could not travel both
[01:53:50] And be one traveler, long I stood
[01:53:51] And looked down one as far as I could
[01:53:51] To where it bent in the undergrowth
[01:53:51] Then took the other, as just as fair
[01:53:52] And having perhaps the better claim
[01:53:52] Because it was grassy and wanted wear
[01:53:52] Though as for that the passing there
[01:53:53] Had worn them really about the same
