[20:33:38] Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
[20:33:38] And sorry I could not travel both
[20:33:38] And be one traveler, long I stood
[20:33:39] And looked down one as far as I could
[20:33:39] To where it bent in the undergrowth
[20:33:39] Then took the other, as just as fair
[20:33:40] And having perhaps the better claim
[20:33:40] Because it was grassy and wanted wear
[20:33:40] Though as for that the passing there
[20:33:41] Had worn them really about the same
