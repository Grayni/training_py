[23:27:26] Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
[23:27:26] And sorry I could not travel both
[23:27:27] And be one traveler, long I stood
[23:27:27] And looked down one as far as I could
[23:27:27] To where it bent in the undergrowth
[23:27:28] Then took the other, as just as fair
[23:27:28] And having perhaps the better claim
[23:27:28] Because it was grassy and wanted wear
[23:27:29] Though as for that the passing there
[23:27:29] Had worn them really about the same
