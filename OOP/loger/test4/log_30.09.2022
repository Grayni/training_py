[19:05:00] Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
[19:05:00] And sorry I could not travel both
[19:05:01] And be one traveler, long I stood
[19:05:01] And looked down one as far as I could
[19:05:01] To where it bent in the undergrowth
[19:05:02] Then took the other, as just as fair
[19:05:02] And having perhaps the better claim
[19:05:02] Because it was grassy and wanted wear
[19:05:03] Though as for that the passing there
[19:05:03] Had worn them really about the same
