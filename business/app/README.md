# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals. Cardiovascular diseases are a major global health concern, and early detection and risk assessment are crucial for effective prevention and treatment.

## Project Overview

- **Problem**: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection of risk factors and prediction of disease risk can help in timely intervention and prevention.

- **Solution**: We have developed a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the probability of an individual developing cardiovascular disease based on various health-related features.

- **Data**: We used a dataset containing information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more for a group of individuals. This data serves as the basis for our predictive model.

- **Technologies**: The project is built using Python, and we employed popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask for data processing, model training, and web deployment.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: We applied data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

- **Machine Learning Model**: We trained a machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Classifier) to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on the provided features.

- **Web Application**: We deployed the model as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input their health data and receive predictions about their cardiovascular disease risk.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the model and receive personalized risk assessments.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow the installation and setup instructions in the provided documentation.

## Usage

1. Access the web application and enter your health information.

2. Click the "Predict" button to receive an estimate of your risk for cardiovascular disease.

3. Use the provided prediction to take appropriate health measures and seek medical advice if necessary.

## Future Enhancements

We plan to further enhance this project by incorporating additional features, improving model accuracy, and extending the application's capabilities for more comprehensive health risk assessments.
