"Anaconda" is a song by Trinidadian-born American rapper Nicki Minaj, from her third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014).
Upon release "Anaconda" was met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics, with some of them praising the song's production and Minaj's return to her hip-hop roots.
To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival.
